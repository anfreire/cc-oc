## 0.1.2 — 2026-05-16

Security and correctness fixes.

- **Shell-safety fix — present since 0.1.0; updating is recommended.** The four `/oc:*` slash-command wrappers passed `$ARGUMENTS` to `oc.mjs` as `<<< "$ARGUMENTS"`. Claude Code substitutes `$ARGUMENTS` textually, so a user's own quotes collided with the wrapper's: any prompt containing quotes or repeated whitespace was corrupted before reaching the model, and a prompt containing shell metacharacters (`;`, `&&`, backticks, …) could execute arbitrary commands. All four wrappers now pass `$ARGUMENTS` through a single-quoted heredoc, so the prompt reaches `oc.mjs` verbatim and the shell never reinterprets it.
- `--cwd` pointing at a non-existent directory failed with a bare `spawn <opencode> ENOENT` that misleadingly implicated the opencode binary; it now fails with a clear `--cwd is not an existing directory: <path>`.
- A non-object `opencode` or `retention` block in `~/.claude/oc.json` was silently discarded by `applyDefaults` before the validator ran. Config validation now runs on the raw parsed config, so a malformed block is rejected with a specific error instead of being ignored.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-15

Friction reduction and graceful-output pass.

- Slash-command wrappers now invoke `node` directly via here-string (`node ... <<< "$ARGUMENTS"`) instead of piping through `printf`, matching their `allowed-tools: Bash(node:*)` declaration and removing implicit `printf` permission prompts on every spawn.
- Background stderr now appears in `/oc:tail` rather than being silently dropped as malformed NDJSON.
- Finished sessions (`completed` / `failed` / `cancelled`) no longer suggest `--follow` or time out in tail.
- Runtime config validation ignores unknown keys and only checks values cc-oc itself consumes (the JSON schema remains strict for editor tooltips).
- Removed `--fresh` flag — it had no positive effect (the default is already a fresh thread; it only error-caught `--continue && --fresh`).
- Command markdown files trimmed: flag tables removed in favour of `--help` (single source of truth in `oc.mjs`).
- Fixes: `--lines 0` now returns zero events; config error messages name the actual path when `CLAUDE_HOME` is set; `findOpencodeBinary` respects the provided env when calling `which`; digest markers and session listing are ASCII-only for non-UTF terminals; quote-stripping handles here-string trailing newlines.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-15

Initial release.

A controlled launcher for [opencode](https://opencode.ai) from inside Claude Code.

Commands:
- `/oc:spawn` — spawn an opencode task (foreground; `--bg` for background)
- `/oc:tail` — stream or peek a session's events (with `--follow` and opencode session-DB fallback)
- `/oc:sessions` — list + inspect spawned sessions
- `/oc:cancel` — cancel one session or `--all` running

Other surface:
- `oc-delegate` subagent — context-firewall forwarder for autonomous use
- Optional `~/.claude/oc.json` configures defaults for every spawn (model, variant, agent, sandbox, MCP exclusions, log retention)
- Per-spawn `--exclude-mcp` to disable specific MCP servers from your opencode config for one run
- Per-spawn `--include-mcp` to re-enable globally-excluded servers for a single run (escape hatch)
- Log retention runs automatically on CC SessionEnd; running bg jobs at session end are marked `detached` (the child keeps running)

Design notes:
- The plugin never modifies your opencode config files. When a spawn excludes MCP servers, cc-oc writes a tiny per-spawn override file and points `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` at it so opencode's native deep-merge disables those servers for that run only.
- Model and variant strings are passed through to opencode verbatim. opencode validates them itself — wrong ids surface as a clean error event.
- No `setup` or `reset` slash commands. Setup checks are folded into spawn-time errors. Maintenance lives in the SessionEnd `gc` hook plus, as an escape hatch, `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/data/oc/`.
